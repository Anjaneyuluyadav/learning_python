1) what is variable ? what
are
the
rules
to
define
variable ?

2) what is the
datatype? how
many
datatypes in python
with example ?

3) what is the output ?  # here ( _ means underscore)
_ = 10
__ = 20
prit( _ + __ )

4) what is the output of below code snippet ?
x=10
y=complex(x)
print( y )

5) what is the output of below code snippet ?
if =100
else =20
print( if + else )

6) what is the output of below code snippet ?
x=65
y=chr(x)
print( y )

7) what is list ? how to define the list with example ?

8) x=[10, 20, 5, 6] output: 20

9) what is the
output
of
below
code
snippet ?
x = [1, 2, 256]
y = bytes(x)
print(y)

10) how
to
find
the
address
of
variable ?

11) what is the
difference
b / w
bytes and bytearry ?

12) x = "Hello python"
output: llo

13) x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
output: [1, 3, 5]

14) can
we
convert
float
to
complex ?

15) x = 10, y = "Hi"
output: 10
Hi

16) x = [10, 30, 50]
output: [50, 30, 10]  # Hint :(use slicing)

17) x = "Hello python"
output: eoyo  # Hint :(use slicing)

18) x = "10"
y = "ten"
output: 200 * ten

19) x = True, y = False
z = int(x) + float(y)
what is the
value
of
z ?

20) x = ["HI", 100, "HELLO", 20]
o / p: 200  # Hint :(get that last ele of ist and multiply by 2)
